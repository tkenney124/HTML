  An AngularJS event will not overwrite an HTML event, both events will be executed.
  You can pass the $event object as an argument when calling the function.
  The $event object contains the browser's event object:
  -->
  <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
    <h1 ng-mousemove="myFunc($event)">Mouse Over Me!</h1>
    <p>Coordinates: {{x + ', ' + y}}</p>
  </div>
  <p>Mouse over the heading to display the value of clientX and clientY from the event object.</p>
  <script>
  var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
  app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    // A controller can also have methods (variables as functions):
    $scope.myFunc = function(myE) {
      $scope.x = myE.clientX;
      $scope.y = myE.clientY;
    }
  });
  </script>
